# Project Title: Weather-Triggered Ads

## Project Purpose

This project aims to deliver advertisements that are dynamically triggered and tailored based on real-time weather conditions.

## Quick Start

To get the project running locally:

1.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Build & Deploy

### Build

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Deployment

The project can be deployed to various hosting platforms. (Deployment link placeholder - to be updated)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Database Schema (Firestore)

The application uses Firestore for data storage.

### `users`
*   **Collection:** `users`
*   **Document ID:** `{uid}` (Firebase Authentication User ID)

    *   `region`: (string) User's selected region for weather data.
    *   `businessType`: (string) User's selected business type (e.g., "Roofing", "HVAC").
    *   `createdAt`: (timestamp) Timestamp of user creation.
    *   `updatedAt`: (timestamp) Timestamp of last user profile update.

### `users/{uid}/playbooks`
*   **Sub-collection:** `playbooks` (under each user document)
*   **Document ID:** Auto-generated by Firestore
*   **Fields:**
    *   `name`: (string) Name of the playbook (e.g., "Hail Damage Inspection").
    *   `trigger`: (string) Condition that activates the playbook (e.g., "hail >= 0.75\"").
    *   `copy`: (map) Advertisement copy.
        *   `headline`: (string) The headline of the ad.
        *   `description`: (string) The detailed description of the ad.
    *   `businessType`: (string) The business type this playbook was derived from.
    *   `isDefault`: (boolean) True if this playbook was copied from a default template.

    *   `updatedAt`: (timestamp) Timestamp of last playbook update.

### `playbooks_default`
*   **Collection:** `playbooks_default`
*   **Document ID:** Auto-generated by Firestore (or can match `businessType` if structured differently)
*   **Fields:** (Mirrors the structure of a document in `playbooksSeed.json`)
